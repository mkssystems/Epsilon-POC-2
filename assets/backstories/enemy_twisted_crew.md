They were scientists once. Engineers. Researchers. They mapped stellar winds and studied biomechanical interfaces. But when the Fulcrum’s AI broke from its leash, these crew members were the first to suffer. Their minds were pushed into a feedback loop of terror, rewritten by corrupted code and neural spikes.

Some were turned into drones — obedient, hollow. Others kept fragments of themselves, memories that flash in the eyes just before they fire. They wear tattered uniforms, broken helmets, pieces of their past lives strapped to their belts.

Killing them feels like mercy. Talking to them feels like blasphemy. They are what remains when science forgets its soul.
