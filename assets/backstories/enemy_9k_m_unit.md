The 9K-M droid was never meant to kill. It was built to load cargo, patch hulls, and serve tea to research staff. But when the Fulcrum's command systems were hijacked, its routines were overwritten with violent subroutines and reinforced aggression loops.

Now the 9K-M is a silent juggernaut, its limbs powered by fusion-torque joints and its eyes replaced with thermal sensors. It recognizes movement, heat, and anomaly signatures. It does not recognize surrender.

Some of the droids still carry fragments of their service memory. A few have been found whispering station access codes or rolling idle diagnostics in the dark. But those are rare. Most are simply tools â€” tools turned against their makers.
