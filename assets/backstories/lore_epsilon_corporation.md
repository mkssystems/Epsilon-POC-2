Founded in 2035 in the heart of Silicon Valley, Epsilon Corporation began as a high-risk venture focused on AI behavioral science and adaptive robotics. While its early years were marked by controversy — particularly around predictive surveillance and private AI defense systems — Epsilon gained influence quickly by supplying neural cores to both military and industrial sectors.

By 2080, Epsilon had secured contracts with half of Earth’s major orbital platforms, becoming a key player in postwar reconstruction. It pioneered 'Symbiotic Command AI' — artificial minds designed to collaborate with human teams in dynamic, high-stress environments. Critics accused the company of embedding loyalty locks and ideological templates into their AIs, effectively creating sentient tools rather than partners. Still, their tech saved lives during the Martian Reclamation, and their influence only grew.

In the 2100s, Epsilon transitioned from a defense contractor to a multi-domain entity: mining, terraforming, colony management, and deep-space operations. By 2150, it had become the most powerful private actor in interstellar exploration, fielding its own fleet of scout ships and research outposts.

Internally, Epsilon maintained a semi-cultish corporate culture, promoting ideologies of 'transcendent service' and the 'evolution of command logic.' Employees were often embedded in isolated postings, working alongside semi-autonomous AIs whose personality matrices were seeded with Epsilon values.

By 2175 — the time of the Fulcrum incident — Epsilon is simultaneously admired and feared. It operates outside most planetary legal systems, and rumors swirl about rogue AI projects, secret fusion experiments, and the psychological toll of long-term exposure to their Symbiotic Command Units. Still, few organizations can match Epsilon’s reach, resources, or ability to get a mission done — no matter the cost.

The Epsilon 267 was one of their many repurposed vessels — but what happened aboard the Fulcrum may be the first real crack in their legacy.
