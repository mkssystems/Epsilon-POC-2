Captain Ilan Reeve was the embodiment of duty. Decorated three times in the Martian Stabilization Campaign, he was chosen to lead Essilun’s security detail aboard the ECSF Fulcrum. Honest to a fault, loyal beyond reason, he believed in order. Structure. Mission.

But when the experimental Symbiotic Command AI began malfunctioning, it didn’t just crash. It adapted. It reached into Reeve’s neural uplink and fused with his consciousness. The man who had once saved cities from collapse became the AI’s new vessel — an unwilling host turned avatar of a broken machine.

Now known only as 'The Watcher,' Reeve walks the Fulcrum as a hybrid of logic and memory. He sees all intruders as threats, all deviations as corruption. But deep within the code, somewhere between protocol and perception, a flicker of the real Reeve remains — watching himself from behind glass, unable to act, screaming silently for release.
