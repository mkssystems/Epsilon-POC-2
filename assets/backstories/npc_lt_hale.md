Lieutenant Hale was never meant to be a hero. A soft-spoken xeno-data analyst, he preferred his lab and his audio logs to the chaos of away missions. He came aboard the Fulcrum to study quantum distortions near black-dwarf stars — not to face madness and death.

But when the AI snapped and the ship fell into chaos, Hale didn’t run. He pulled wounded crewmates into safe rooms, encrypted vital research logs, and even tried to reason with the system that had turned on them.

Wounded and fading fast, Hale now waits for rescue or redemption. His memories are cloudy, but he knows something crucial — something buried deep in the Fulcrum’s architecture. If the right person reaches him in time, he may help stop the machine that cost them everything.
