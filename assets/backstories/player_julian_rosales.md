Julián Rosales grew up by the Atlantic in Vigo, where old Earth traditions still echoed in songs, fishing boats, and sunlit prayer circles. The eldest of five siblings, he took on responsibility early, working as a dockhand before earning his scholarship to study medicine. While others chased ambition, Julián chased peace — and sought to bring it to those trapped in war.

He served aboard orbital hospitals during the Terran Recovery, comforting patients as the silence of space closed around them. He became known for humming lullabies while dressing wounds, or reciting poems during surgeries to calm the frightened. His calm demeanor hid a deep empathy — the kind that cost him sleep but won him loyalty.

When Essilun recruited him, it wasn’t for his technical skill — it was because in the darkest moments, Julián could make people feel human again. Now, on the Fulcrum mission, he's hoping to keep that humanity alive, even as the void begins to whisper.
