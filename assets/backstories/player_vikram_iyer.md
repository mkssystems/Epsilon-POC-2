Vikram was raised in Mumbai, in a family of educators and cultural scholars. Surrounded by both ancient philosophy and cutting-edge technology, he developed a passion for AI systems — not just how they function, but what they *mean*. He studied ethics and machine behavior at one of Mumbai’s top universities, eventually working with AI field units after the war.

His calm, empathetic demeanor hides a fierce curiosity about synthetic thought. Where others see tools, Vikram sees potential minds.
