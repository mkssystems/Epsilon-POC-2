Epsilon 267 - this is the name your ship has been given in the shipyard, orbiting Venus. There was no big celebration as the class was forged in hundreds during the Third War of Solar System. Now decommissioned as the war ended, this light scouting ship was purchased by Essilun Corporation for deep space exploration. You, along with others, have been hired by Essilun Corp. as its crew. The captain of the ship was AI.

Your first mission was ordered just a few days after your new job. You were given orders to sail outside the solar system, to Alpha Centauri, where you were to get new orders. The trip was actually easy, and quite boring, however, you and your colleagues could get more familiar with each other and introduce yourselves.

Once you arrived at Alpha Centauri, after refueling, you got a new mission. Scout the nearby system of Ross 154. While en route, the ship received an S.O.S signal along with a frantic message:

(...) blurp...tschhh, blurp, tscchhh we need help! Our ship has been hijacked and we need urgent assistance! We are part of the Essilun science team. Oh nooo! He is already hereâ€¦ tsche AGHHHHAH! [end of transmission]

The ship AI captain, after confirming with HQ, changes the course and sails in the direction of the distress call.

After a standard one day in flight, Epsilon 267 reached the ship. The ship was not responding to communication. The AI Captain gave you orders to dock with the ship and perform a search and rescue mission. Your task is to explore the ship, find out what happened, rescue the science crew, and then hail the Epsilon 267 to pick you up.

As you approach the docking bay, you see that the ship was attacked; the hull was breached in several places and damage was visible. However, the damage was not critical and the ship appeared to be generally functional. Nearing the hatch, you could finally see the ship's name - "ECSF Fulcrum". Once you're inside and the hatch closed again, you could see that the Epsilon 267 flies away.
